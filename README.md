# Optimizing Data for Analytics: A SQL Data Warehouse & Pipeline Using Medallion Architecture

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to Analytics-Ready Insights. Here's a sneak peak of the raw data!
![Data](docs/Data_Integration.png)

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
